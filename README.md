# First step in our internal tool

So this is the App Script code I've programmed to get our consultants inputs from Google Sheets and ping them all to our magical elves living in Google Cloud Functions. Those elves then do magical things, push the data to BigQuery from where we pull it back to Sheets using Supermetrics.

If you look at the code, it's probably not a surprise for what kind of purpose this has been programmed :)
